# Bubble Sort Algorithm

O(n^2) Stable, in-place

Simple algorithm but too slow. Not recommended when n is too large.

Advantage: ability to check if list is already sorted. When is sorted (best-case) it's only O(n)

Compares each pair of adjacent items and swap if they're in the wrong order. This is how the highest value bubbles up to the end of the list in each pass.
