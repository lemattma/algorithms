# Insertion Sort Algorithm

O(n^2) Stable, in-place

Divides the array into two subsets, sorted and unsorted.
Initially the osrted subset will contain only the index 0.

Not the best in terms of performance, but more efficient than
other O(n^2) algorithms such as selection or bubble sort
Not fast due to nested loops
Useful for small datasets
